Can anybody find me somebody to love
Ooh each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief Lord
Somebody ooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
I work hard every day of my life
I work 'til I ache in my bones
At the end
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
'Til the tears run down from my eyes
Lord somebody ooh somebody
can anybody find me somebody to love?
Everyday I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Ah got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe in
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh Lord
Ooh somebody ooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Got no feel I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I'm OK I'm alright
I ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
One day I'm gonna be free Lord
